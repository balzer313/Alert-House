# **AlertHouse ðŸš¨** 

## Overview

**AlertHouse** is a secure application designed to transform any home into a smart house, offering alerts for rocket attacks in real-time. Developed to support Israelis during frequent rocket threats, AlertHouse notifies users through physical cuesâ€”such as flashing smart bulbsâ€”and captures Iron Dome interceptions, streaming and storing the footage locally.
